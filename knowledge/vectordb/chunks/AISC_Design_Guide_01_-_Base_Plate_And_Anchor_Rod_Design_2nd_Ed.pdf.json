Because tall pole-type structures are non-\nredundant and are subject to fatigue due to wind flutter spe-\ncial inspection and tightening procedures should be used.","376":"bject to fatigue due to wind flutter spe-\ncial inspection and tightening procedures should be used. \nStudies have shown that pretension in the rod between the \ntwo nuts improves fatigue strength and ensures good load \ndistribution among the anchor rods (Frank, 1980; Kaczinski \net al., 1996). The base plates of light and sign standards are \nnot grouted after erection, and the rod carries the all of the \nstructural load. The anchor rods must be designed for ten-\nsion, compression, and shear, and the foundation must be \ndesigned to receive these loads from the anchor rods.","377":"ssion, and shear, and the foundation must be \ndesigned to receive these loads from the anchor rods.\nMachinery bases and certain columns may require very \nclose alignment of the anchor rods.

Even when \ntensioning a Grade 55 rod 24 in. long, it only takes concrete \ncreep/shrinkage of 0.05 in. to relieve all of the pretension.","379":"24 in. long, it only takes concrete \ncreep/shrinkage of 0.05 in. to relieve all of the pretension. \nThus, it is recommended, when it is necessary to pretension \nanchor rods, that a steel sleeve be used that is adequate to \ntransfer the anchor rod pretension from the anchor plate to \nthe base plate. See Figure A1.1.\nLarge mill building columns that have to be set accurately \nand have large moments at the base can be designed using a \nstool-type detail as shown in Figure A1.2.
