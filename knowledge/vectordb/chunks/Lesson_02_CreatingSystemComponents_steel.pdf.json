These properties can then be used for all projects. \n• When you modify a main objects profile in the model all of the connections to the object \nare automatically modified at the same time. \n• If you select options such as edit, copy, or mirror, all connections are automatically \nincluded. The connections that are copied or mirrored are exactly the same as the \noriginals. The same applies to plates and bolts. \n• With AutoDefaults you can create rules defining when to use different connection \nproperties. \nAll available system components are located in the component catalog, which can be opened \nusing Ctrl+F or by clicking the binocular icon on the component toolbar.","3":"different connection \nproperties. \nAll available system components are located in the component catalog, which can be opened \nusing Ctrl+F or by clicking the binocular icon on the component toolbar. \n \nWhen applying a connection that you are unfamiliar with, accept the default properties and \ncreate the connection. Then look to see what needs to be modified. This is usually quicker \nthan trying to set the values for the connection before seeing what the connection actually \ncreates. \nHelp: Detailing > Getting started > Using components > Creating components\nHelp: Detailing > Getting started > Basics > Component concepts\n Copyright © 2006 Tekla Corporation TEKLA STRUCTURES BASIC TRAINING  \n3 \n  Creating System Components for Steel  \n \n\nHelp: Detailing > Getting started > Basics > Picking order\nHelp: Detailing > Getting started > Basics > Up direction\nCheck clashing of steel structures \nIn Chapter 1 we created a model of a small industrial structure.
