As indicated in Chapter B of the Specification, designs can \nbe made according to either ASD or LRFD provisions. \nThere  are  a  wide  array  of  stainless  steel  types  available  for  structural  applications.  The  \nproperties of stainless steels differ significantly from the properties of the steels covered in \nthe AISC Specification for Structural Steel Buildings.
