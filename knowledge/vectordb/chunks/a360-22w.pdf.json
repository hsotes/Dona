GENERAL STABILITY REQUIREMENTS \nThere are many parameters and behavioral effects that influence the stability of steel-\nframed  structures  (Birnstiel  and  Iffland,  1980;  McGuire,  1992;  White  and  Chen,  \n1993;  ASCE,  1997;  Ziemian,  2010).","2375":"l  and  Iffland,  1980;  McGuire,  1992;  White  and  Chen,  \n1993;  ASCE,  1997;  Ziemian,  2010).  The  stability  of  structures  and  individual  ele-\nments must be considered from the standpoint of the structure as a whole, including \nnot only compression members, but also beams, bracing systems, and connections.\nMany  building  codes  include  stiffness  requirements  for  control  of  seismic  drift,  \nwhich  act  as  an  indirect  limit  on  sidesway  amplification.","2376":"r  control  of  seismic  drift,  \nwhich  act  as  an  indirect  limit  on  sidesway  amplification.

Drain Holes\nBecause the interior of an HSS is difficult to inspect, concern is sometimes expressed \nregarding  internal  corrosion.  However,  good  design  practice  can  eliminate  the  \nconcern  and  the  need  for  expensive  protection.  Corrosion  occurs  in  the  presence  \nof oxygen and water.

Therefore,  internal  \ncorrosion protection is a consideration only in HSS that are exposed to weather.

The oxidation \ndepth is insignificant when the corrosion process must stop, even when a corrosive \natmosphere exists at the time of sealing.","3815":"n the corrosion process must stop, even when a corrosive \natmosphere exists at the time of sealing. If fine openings exist at connections, mois-\nture  and  air  can  enter  the  HSS  through  capillary  action  or  by  aspiration  due  to  the  \npartial vacuum that is created if the HSS is cooled rapidly (Blodgett, 1967).
