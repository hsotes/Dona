You can then apply the custom component to \nsimilar framing conditions in the model.","2":"ng the information the user needs to input, for example, main part, \nsecondary parts, or points they need to pick. You can then apply the custom component to \nsimilar framing conditions in the model. \nWe will now create a custom component from the column-beam connection, which was \ninteractively created in Lesson 3. By changing the connection to a custom component you \ncan use it in other parts of the model and in other models. \n \nZoom in close to the component, which was interactively created between a column and a \nbeam in lesson 3.
